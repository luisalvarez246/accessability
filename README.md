## Description
AccessAbility was developed as part of the final group project for the Accessible App Contest. The primary aim of this project is to provide a user-friendly web platform that enables individuals to search for accessible establishments by location, establishment type (e.g., restaurants, hotels, cinemas), and type of disability (physical, hearing impairments, and visual impairments). The project is built using Vue 3 with Vuetify and Vitest for the frontend, and Java Spring Boot for the backend, with MySQL as the chosen database management system.

AccessAbility is designed with a strong emphasis on accessibility, allowing users to navigate using only the keyboard and supporting screen readers like Pericles. The website is also optimized for zoom functionality up to 200% in the web browser. It allows the registration of establishments and is fully responsive for a seamless experience on different devices.
